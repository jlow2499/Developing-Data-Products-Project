# Developing-Data-Products-Project
The following is a self contained web application that explores the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) complaint database. The database contains every consumer complaint to the CFPB since January 2012. The motivation for the use of this data set comes from me working in the Student Loan industry. 

If you plan to run this application on your own computer you will first need to download the data. The data for this project is available at the below data.gov website. Save the data as complaints.csv in your parent working directory. ("~/") The app will also need to be in your parent directory for the file to work. Once App.R and complaints.csv is in your parent directory you will need to make sure you install the following packages (otherwise the application may take awhile to load): shiny, shinydashboard, DT, dplyr, googleVis, xts, and dygraphs.
